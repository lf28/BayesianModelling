# Bayesian Modelling
 

Bayesian modelling is a free course for University of St Andrews staff and research degree students. The course covers applied Bayesian inference to some common statistical inference problems such as linear and non-linear regressions and classifications. Some Bayesian machine learning concepts will also be covered. 

The methods covered will be implemented using a new programming language, Julia, and the course includes a substantial practical component.  

The course is facilitated by St Leonard's Postgraduate College and CREEM and delivered by the School of Computer Science.

## Content and Structure 
The course covers three main parts:
1. The modelling principles that underlie the Bayesian statistical paradigm
    * The modelling principles of Bayesian inference
    * Directed graphical models as a modelling tool
2.	Approximate Bayesian inference algorithms 
    * MCMC algorithms
3. Applied Bayesian modelling with probabilistic programming languages
    * Regression problem
    * Classification problem
    * Generalised regression problem


## Learning Outcomes

After taking the course, participants should be able to: 
* Understand the principles that underline the Bayesian statistical paradigm
* Understand the needs of the Bayesian statistical paradigm in machine learning and statistical learning
* Understand the main computational algorithms for implementing Bayesian statistical inference 
* Use probabilistic programming languages to do applied Bayesian modelling and computation
