# Bayesian inference with `Turing.jl`

md"""

In the previous chapters, we have introduced some basic concepts of Bayesian inference and MCMC samplers. In a nutshell, Bayesian inference requires a full generative model which includes both prior assumptions for the unknown and the likelihood function for the observed. After the modelling step, efficient algorithms, such as MCMC, are used to compute the posterior distribution. 

So far, we have implemented all of the Bayesian models and their inference algorithms manually. Writing programs from scratch requires prior programming experience and effort. Therefore, starting everything from scratch is not practical for general applied practitioners. 

Fortunately, with the help of probabilistic programming languages (PPL), such as `Turing.jl` or `Stan`, one can do Bayesian inferences easily without worrying too much about the technical details. A PPL is a programming language to specify and infer general-purpose probabilistic models. They provide a high-level and intuitive-to-use way of specifying Bayesian models. Moreover, a PPL unifies the modelling and computation blocks. Bayesian computations, such as MCMC, can be (almost) carried out automatically once a model is specified. 

In this chapter, we are going to learn how to use `Turing.jl`, a popular PPL implemented in Julia, to run Bayesian inferences. `Turing.jl` is very easy to use. The user writes Turing models in the same way as they would write on their paper, which makes it intuitive to use. Together with other helper packages, such as `MCMCChains.jl` (for MCMC chain summary) and `Plots.jl` (for visualisation), the packages provide an ecosystem to do full Bayesian inference.

### Model specification

In a nutshell, a model in Turing is implemented as a Julia function wrapped with a `@model` macro. Intuitively, the macro rewrites the wrapped Julia function to a probabilistic model such that downstream model operations can be carried out.

A general Turing model is listed below:

```julia
@model function my_model(data)
  ...
  # random variable `θ` with prior distribution `prior_dist`
  θ ~ prior_dist
  ...
  # optional deterministic transformations 
  ϕ = fun(θ)
  ...

  # observation `data` with likelihood distribution `likelihood_dist`
  data ~ likelihood_dist
  ...
end
```

Two important constructs of `Turing.jl` are

* macro "`@model`": a macro that rewrites a Julia function to a probabilistic program that can be inferred later on; all model assumptions are encapsulated within the macro
  
* operator "`~`": the tilde operator is used to specify a variable that follows some probability distribution: e.g.
  > ```θ ~ Beta(1,1); data ~ Bernoulli(θ)```
  * where we assume `data` is a random draw from a Bernoulli with bias `θ`; and the bias `θ` follows a flat Beta prior
  * check [`Distributions.jl`](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/starting/) for available probability distributions and their interfaces.


A Turing model can be specified with arbitrary Julia code. For example,
* `for, while` loop: can be used to specify some repeated distribution assumptions, 
  * convenient for `i.i.d` assumption for the observed the data

* `=` assignment: can be used to assign a deterministic value to a variable; e.g.
  > ```μ = 0; data ~ Normal(μ, 1)```
  * a Gaussian distribution with a fixed mean of 1
  * note `=` is different from `~` operator; `~` is used to specify a distribution assumption for a random variable; `=` is a deterministic non-random assignment

### Inference

Recall that MCMC provides us with a general and scalable method to draw samples from the posterior distribution which usually cannot be computed exactly:

$$\theta^{(r)} \sim p(\theta|\mathcal D)$$

Instead of writing one's own MCMC algorithms, `Turing.jl` provides an easy-to-use interface: `sample()`:


```julia
chain = sample(model, mcmc_algorithm, mc; 
			discard_initial = 100, 
			thinning=10, 
			chain_type=Chains
		)

```

The first three compulsory arguments are  
* `model`: a Turing model should be the first argument, e.g. `cf_model`
* `mcmc_algorithm`: can be one of the available MCMC samplers, such as a Hamiltonian sampler with a certain step length and size: `HMC(0.05, 10)`; or HMC's more user-friendly extension No-U-turn sampler: `NUTS()` (which automatically choose the step size and length)
* `mc`: how many MCMC samples to draw, e.g. `3000`

The optional arguments (by Julia's convention optional arguments are specified after `;`) are
* `discard_initial`: discard the specified number of samples as burn-in
* `thinning`: thin the chain to reduce temporal correlations between MCMC iterations
* `chain_type`: return the sample as an object of `Chains` of `MCMCChains.jl`;

**Run multiple chains in parallel.** To make use of modern computers' parallel processing power, we usually simulate multiple chains in parallel. One can also simulate multiple MCMC chains in parallel by calling

```julia
sample(model, mcmc_algorithm, parallel_type, n, n_chains)
```

where 

* `parallel_type` can be e.g. `MCMCThreads()` 
* `n_chains` is the number of parallel chains to simulate at the same time

md"""

Some MCMC algorithms such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) require the gradient of the log probability density functions.

As shown in chapter 3, packages such as `ForwardDiff.jl` can automatically differentiate a Julia program. With the auto-differentiation (AD) packages serving as backends, `Turing` can compute the gradient automatically. Different backends and algorithms supported in `Turing.jl` include:
- [ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl): forward-mode AD, the default backend
- [Tracker.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Tracker.jl): reverse-mode AD
- [ReverseDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl): reverse-mode AD, has to be loaded explicitly (optional cache for some models)
- [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl): reverse-mode AD, has to be loaded explicitly

By default, `Turing` uses `ForwardDiff`. One can change the AD backend by `setadbackend(:backend)`, e.g. `setadbackend(:forwarddiff)`, `setadbackend(:tracker)`, `setadbackend(:reversediff)`, or `setadbackend(:zygote)`.

As a rule of thumb, use forward-mode AD for models with few parameters (say less than 50) and reverse-mode AD for models with many parameters. If you use reverse-mode AD, in particular with Tracker or Zygote, you should avoid
    loops and use vectorized operations.

### Inference with `Turing.jl`
To reflect the fact that each scientist has different experimental skills, we modify the usual i.i.d. assumption for the data. In chapter 2, we assume each observation is an independent realisation of the signal plus some subject-specific observation noise. That is each scientist makes observations with his/her noise level ``\sigma^2_n`` for ``n = 1,2,\ldots, 7``.

Here we make a small adjustment to the above assumption. Instead of assuming 7 different levels of skill, we assume scientists A and B have a similar level of skill whereas scientists C, D, E, F, and G are another group with better measurement skills. We have reduced the number of observation noise parameters from 7 to 2.

The proposed Bayesian model becomes:
```math
\begin{align}
\text{prior}: \mu &\sim \mathcal N(m_0=0, v_0=10000)\\
\lambda_1 &\sim \texttt{Gamma}(a_0=0.5, b_0=0.5)\\
\lambda_2 &\sim \texttt{Gamma}(a_0=0.5, b_0=0.5)\\
\text{likelihood}: d_1, d_2 &\sim \mathcal N(\mu, 1/\lambda_1) \\
d_n &\sim \mathcal N(\mu, 1/\lambda_2), \;\; \text{for }n = 3, \ldots, 7.
\end{align}
```

Note that the first observations now share one observation precision while the rest 5 share another. The model can be translated to `Turing.jl` easily.

## Predictive check with `Turing.jl`



"""

# ╔═╡ 7f16ec4f-ea2f-4990-9a6b-e473b997d786
md"""

Predictive checks are effective tools to evaluate whether the assumptions we make in the modelling stage are a good fit with the real data-generation process. The idea behind the checks is to generate simulated data using samples based on the prior or posterior distribution and compare them to the observed data. And the two checks are called **prior predictive check** and **posterior predictive check**. 

The data simulation process is listed below:
!!! information ""
	Repeat the following many times:
	
	1. First draw one sample from the posterior (or the prior for prior predictive check): 
	  
	$$\tilde \theta \sim p(\theta|\mathcal D)$$
	2. Second, conditioning on ``\tilde \theta``, simulates the pseudo observations: 
	
	$$\tilde{\mathcal D}\sim p(\mathcal D|\tilde{\theta})$$

In chapter 2, we have done the simulation manually. For more complicated models, the process soon becomes tedious and overly-complicated. Fortunately, `Turing.jl` provides an easy-to-use tool called `predict()` to semi-automate the process.

Recall that when `Turing.jl` carries out the sampling procedure, all random variables (specified on the left-hand side of `~`) will be sampled except those being passed as concrete observations, such as `data` in the coin flipping example. To trigger the program to sample the observation, one can pass an array of `missing` type instead of the observed data. `missing` is a special data type in Julia to indicate the value of a variable is missing. For `Turing`, all `missing` type of variables which are on the left side of `~` expression will be sampled.


To be more specific, to simulate data ``\mathcal D_{pred}`` based on a predictive distribution, one should carry out the following steps:
1. create a data array with ``N`` `missing` elements, e.g. `D_missing = Vector{Union{Missing, Bool}}(undef, N)`
2. initialise a `Turing` model with the missing data as an augment, e.g. `missing_model = turing_model(D_missing)`

Foldable("Exact Bayesian computation with the conjugate prior model.", md"
Since a conjugate prior is used, the posterior computation is very straightforward. Apply Baye's rule, we find the posterior is 


```math
p(\theta|\mathcal D) = \texttt{Beta}(\theta; a_N, b_N) = \frac{1}{\text{B}(a_N, b_N)} \theta^{a_N-1}(1-\theta)^{b_N-1},
```

where ``a_N= a_0 + N_h`` and ``b_N = b_0 + N - N_h``; and ``N_h = \sum_i d_i`` is the total number of heads observed in the ``N`` tosses.

Apply Baye's rule, we have 

```math
\begin{align}
p(\theta|\mathcal D) &\propto p(\theta) p(\mathcal D|\theta) \\
&= \frac{1}{\text{B}(a_0, b_0)} \theta^{a_0-1}(1-\theta)^{b_0-1} \theta^{\sum_n d_n} (1-\theta)^{N-\sum_n d_n}\\
&= \theta^{a_0+ \sum_{n} d_n -1}(1-\theta)^{b_0+N-\sum_n d_n -1}\\
&= \theta^{a_N -1}(1-\theta)^{b_N -1},
\end{align} 
```
where ``a_N= a_0 + N_h`` and ``b_N = b_0 + N - N_h``.
Next we needs to normalise the non-normalised posterior to find the exact posterior distribution. The normalising constant is:

$$\int_{0}^1 \theta^{a_N -1}(1-\theta)^{b_N -1} d\theta$$

We recognise the unnormalised distribution is a Beta distribution with the updated parameters ``a_N= a_0 + N_h`` and ``b_N = b_0 + N - N_h``; the normalising constant must be ``B(a_N, b_N)``. Therefore, 

$$p(\theta|\mathcal D) =\text{Beta}(a_N, b_N).$$

To demonstrate the idea, we choose a noninformative flat prior ``a_0=b_0 =1``; the posterior is of a Beta form with updated counts of heads and tails: 

$$p(\theta|\mathcal D) = \texttt{Beta}(8, 4).$$ The corresponding prior and update posterior is shown below. The posterior (light orange curve) updates the flat prior (blue curve) by incorporating the likelihood. Since 7 out of the 10 tosses are head, the posterior correctly reflects this observed information.
